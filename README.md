# 🧪 Chemistry Engine

A modular, scalable, and extensible chemistry engine written in Python.

Chemistry Engine is an open-source project designed to analyze, classify, and process chemical compounds using a clean, modular architecture. The long-term vision is to build a complete chemistry framework capable of supporting chemical calculations, reaction prediction, molecular analysis, and AI-assisted chemistry applications.
